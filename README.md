# progs
Python modules for handling core-collapse supernova progenitors.

The main purpose is to provide a generalised method of loading data from different sets of existing progenitor models.
These models are provided in a variety of formats, so I'd like to be able to easily load data from them without needing to think about the underlying data structure.
